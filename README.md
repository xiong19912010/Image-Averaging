# Image-Averaging
Dealing with Cryo-EM image is much more complicated than traditional one, because usually the SNR (signal to noise ratio) is below 0.1. Image averaging is a good way to increase the SNR. This code is designed for this purpose. Here, we consider the orientation of particles (among each image) and average the particles of interest.
